Extragalactic background light (EBL) model from Finke et al. 2022, "Modeling the Extragalactic Background Light and the Cosmic Star Formation History" (DOI:10.3847/1538-4357/ac9843)

Files obtained from:  https://zenodo.org/record/7023073  (at 2023-06-06)
Included in this database are the luminosity densities, EBL energy density/intensities, and gamma-ray absorption optical depths for the fiducial 'model A'.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These tables contain the energy density data from the publication above.
Each file represents a different redshift (from z = 0.00 up to z = 7.00 in steps of 0.02). 
The first column (which is the same in each file) is the photon energy (eV) and the second column is the comoving photon density (erg/cm^3).
